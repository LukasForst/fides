\section*{Acknowledgment}
First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor Sebastian Garcia for countless consultations and brainstormings and mainly for the significant amount of his time he invested in me and this thesis. Thank you.

I want to say thank you to the whole Stratosphere Research Laboratory, specifically to Veronica Valeros, Maria Rigaki, and Ondřej Lukáš, for providing me with all support I needed, for proofreading the thesis, and for guiding me through the academic world.
I'm grateful for doing this work with you and being part of the team in Stratosphere.

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and my whole family for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process of researching and writing this thesis. 

\bigskip \noindent
This accomplishment would not have been possible without you.
  
\bigskip \noindent
Thank you.
