Here we will describe what the previous work is - Dita's Dovecot, Eigen Trust, Sality, SORT etc.
Here we want to outline what the Slips is in few words.

\section{Peer-to-peer Networks}
\label{sec:peer-to-peer-networks}
Peer-to-peer network is a distributed network of computers without direct hierarchy where nodes (peers) communicate with each other directly, without using centralized server, or any authority.\cite{schollmeier}.
Unlike more standard client-server networks, where the server is designed to provide data and client consumes them, in peer-to-peer networks all peers are even in terms of permissions and what services do they provide.
Moreover, the peers are free to join and leave the network any time, which makes the networks dynamic and it does not provide much guarantees about data availability.
