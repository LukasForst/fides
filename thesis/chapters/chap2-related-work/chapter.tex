\chapter{Previous Work and Background}
\label{ch:previous-work-background}
This chapter outlines security tools used in the local networks and describes what threat intelligence is.
Then we describe the basic concepts of peer-to-peer networks and how the trust relationships are modeled in them.
Modeling trust in peer-to-peer networks is not a new concept. Thus we describe previous work in this area and explain why we designed a new trust model for sharing threat intelligence in peer-to-peer networks of Intrusion Prevention Systems.
