\chapter{Previous Work and Background}
\label{ch:previous-work-background}
In this chapter we outline security tools that are used to secure any type of network and describe what is the threat intelligence.
Then we describe basic concepts of peer-to-peer networks and how is are the trust relations modeled in them.
Modeling trust in peer-to-peer networks is not a new concept, thus we describe previous work on this topic and explain why we designed new trust model for sharing threat intelligence in peer-to-peer networks of Intrusion Prevention Systems.
