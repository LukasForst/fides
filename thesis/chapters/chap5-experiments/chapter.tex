\chapter{Experiments}
\label{ch:experiments}
We designed a single and comprehensive experiment that simulates a real-world usage of Fides. This chapter describes how we set up an environment that allows us to run experiments and simulate real-world situations in the peer-to-peer network where the peers communicate and share threat intelligence.

In Section~\ref{sec:sampling-threat-intelligence} we describe how we sample threat intelligence shared by the peers.
In the following Section~(\ref{sec:peers-behavioral-patterns}), we list different types of peers in the network, what is their goal, and how they behave.
Section~\ref{sec:environment-simulation} then describes how we designed the environment and what are the inputs for the simulation itself.
The last Section~(\ref{sec:experiments-evaluation}) presents how we evaluate each scenario and explains the vital simulation indicators.
