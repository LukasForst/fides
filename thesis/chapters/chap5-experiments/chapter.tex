We designed a single and comprehensive experiment that simulates a real world usage of the Fides. \todo{we need a bit more motivation here}

\section{Environment Simulation}
\label{sec:environment-simulation}
We will be simulation a global peer-to-peer environment where the peers have one of the behaviors described in \ref{sec:peers-behavioral-patterns}.

Simulation itself have following parameters
\begin{itemize}
    \item number of peers in the network - $1..25$
    \item \% of peers that are pre-trusted and thus have higher starting service trust AND can not be malicious $0..100\%$
    \item for each type of strategy (type of peers) \% of them in the network
    \item number of targets that the local peer will be asking about and their $1..10$, labels (for example 3 peers where there are two being and one malicious)
    \item period of time when the peers will be only gaining trust (malicious peers do not lie) - $0..50$
    \item number of peers that join later during the simulation
\end{itemize}

Each peer will have following parameters
\begin{itemize}
    \item type of strategy (that includes if the peer is malicious or not
    \item is part of pre-trusted organization or not
    \item when the peer joined the network
\end{itemize}

For malicious peer 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \% of targets that the peer is going to lie about
\end{itemize}

For peers joining later in the process.
\begin{itemize}
    \item type of the joining peer (its strategy)
    \item when it appears
\end{itemize}
