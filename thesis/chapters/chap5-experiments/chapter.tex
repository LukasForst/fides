\chapter{Experiments}
\label{ch:experiments}
We designed a single and comprehensive experiment that simulates a real-world usage of the Fides.
In this chapter, we describe how we set up an environment that allows us to run experiments and simulate real-world situations in the peer-to-peer network where the peers communicate between each other and share threat intelligence.

In the section \ref{sec:sampling-threat-intelligence} we describe how we sample threat intelligence that is being shared by the peers.
In the following section \ref{sec:peers-behavioral-patterns}, we list different types of peers in the network, what is their goals, and how they behave.
The following section \ref{sec:environment-simulation} then describes how we designed the environment and what are the inputs for the simulation itself.
The last section \ref{sec:experiments-evaluation} then presents how we evaluate each scenario and explains what are the important simulation indicators.
