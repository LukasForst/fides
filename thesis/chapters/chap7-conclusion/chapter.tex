In this thesis, we proposed, designed, and implemented \textbf{Fides}. Fides is a generic trust model fine-tuned for sharing security threat intelligence in highly adversarial global peer-to-peer networks of intrusion prevention agents.
Fides enables threat intelligence sharing in global peer-to-peer networks of Intrusion Prevention Agents agents and allows them to cooperate against malicious actors without compromising the security of the local environment. 
Although Fides is fine-tuned for threat intelligence sharing, it is generic and can be easily modified to share any other IoC data.

We conclude that Fides is a viable solution for managing trust relationships in the peer-to-peer networks and it is robust enough to work under highly-adversarial situations. Even in these situations, it can correctly identify the truth of the shared threat intelligence data, and also identify the truth about how much to trust the peers.

Thanks to all the configurations and optimizations that Fides brings for usage inside the organizations, we believe that Fides enables the Slips Intrusion Prevention System adoption across a broader spectrum of organizations.
We believe that Slips, combined with Fides, will enable more possibilities for sharing threat intelligence over the internet and improve the overall security of the networks that use Slips for the defense against intruders.
