\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}
In this thesis, we proposed, designed and implemented trust model for distributed multi-agent environments of intrusion prevention systems \textbf{Fides}.
Fides enables threat intelligence sharing in global peer-to-peer networks of Slips agents and allows them to cooperate against malicious actors without compromising security of the local environment. 
We analyzed previous work and various trust models in chapter \ref{ch:previous-work-background}.
In the following chapter \ref{ch:trust-model-design}, we proposed and designed computational model of Fides.
In section \ref{sec:attack-vectors}, we described common attacks on the trust models in general and analyzed possible attack vectors for Fides.
Architecture and implementation of the trust model is then described in the chapter \ref{ch:architecture}.
We designed extensive test scenarios and executed 165 890 different test cases in chapter \ref{ch:experiments}.
Experiments and the trust model itself was then evaluated in the chapter \ref{ch:results}.


\section{Discussion}

here we want to speculate a bit about what we achieved and what is great\todo{write this}
