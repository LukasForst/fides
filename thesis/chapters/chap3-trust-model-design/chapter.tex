\chapter{Trust Model Design}
\label{ch:trust-model-design}
This thesis aims to design and implement a trust model for sharing threat intelligence in global peer-to-peer networks where the peers are instances of intrusion prevention systems.
The previous chapter outlined what threat intelligence is, how it is generated, and why trust relationships are essential when making decisions based on the said threat intelligence.
We described the trust models in the context of peer-to-peer networks and analyzed the notable ones.
We discovered the promising trust model SORT~,\cite{sort} which we described in section~\ref{subsec:sort}. After careful analysis, we decided to use SORT's algorithm as a base for our trust model design mainly because of its flexibility and modularity.

In this chapter, we propose a new trust model \textbf{Fides}.
Fides was named after the ancient goddess of trust and good faith Fides~\cite{enwiki:1086924565}.
The trust model utilizes modified SORT's computational model with multiple modifications and extensions that allow it to work in highly adversarial global peer-to-peer networks effectively.
Fides is a generic and heavily configurable trust model specializing in sharing threat intelligence.
However, thanks to its modular architecture, it can operate with any data, and it is not limited only to threat intelligence.

In the section~,\ref{sec:general-overview-of-fides} we describe our trust model design and explain how Fides works on a high level, the inputs and outputs, and how it behaves in which situation.

After outlining the general overview, we analyze the weaknesses of the trust models and how they apply to Fides.
First, we start with \textit{the cold start problem} in the section~\ref{sec:cold-start-problem}, which describes how peers can gain trust when they are new in the network and how Fides tackles this issue.

In the next section~\ref{sec:attack-vectors} we analyze possible attack vectors on our trust model, and then we describe the taxonomy of attacks in the next section~\ref{sec:taxonomy-of-attacks}.

Once all trust model requirements are explained, we dive deep into Fides's computational model in the next section~\ref{sec:computational-model}  and explain how it can uncover trust relationships in the network.
The following section~\ref{sec:interaction-evaluation-strategies} explains how Fides can evaluate interactions between peers and how that affects trust.
Because Fides specializes in sharing threat intelligence and integrates with Slips, in the next section~\ref{sec:network-intelligence-aggregation} we explain how Fides aggregates the weighted threat intelligence from the network.

\noindent
In the upcoming pages, we use the following terminology to talk about the trust model.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Target}: An identification of a resource for which is Slips able to generate threat intelligence. It can be, for example, either an IP address, domain, or hashes.

\item \textbf{Local Peer}: The unique local instance of Slips that are connected to the global P2P network and runs Fides. In equations, we use $i$ when referring to the local peer.

\item \textbf{Remote Peer}. A peer on the Internet is connected to the global Slips P2P2 network. In equations, we use $j$ when referring to the remote peer.

\item \textbf{Service Trust}: How much does Fides trust a remote peer that it provides the local peer with good service. In other words, to what extent does Fides trust a specific peer that it provides correct and valuable threat intelligence. We denote it $st$ and discuss it in detail in section~\ref{subsec:service-trust}.
