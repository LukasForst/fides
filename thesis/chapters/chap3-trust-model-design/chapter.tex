\chapter{Trust Model Design}
\label{ch:trust-model-design}
In this chapter, we describe how we approached problems of trust in global peer-to-peer environments in Section \ref{sec:computational-model},how can we evaluate single interaction between two peers in Section \ref{sec:interaction-evaluation-strategies}, how we mitigate cold start problem in Section \ref{sec:cold-start-problem} and finally, how do we aggregate network threat intelligence into a single network opinion in Section \ref{sec:network-intelligence-aggregation}.

Our trust model, Fides, operates in four phases, first it receives data, then it aggregates the data, evaluates the interactions with each peer and as a last step it updates the service trust for the next interaction.
See figure \ref{fig:trust-model-life-cycle}, where is this process visualized.

In the following sections we will be using this terminology to talk about the trust model.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Service Trust}: How much Fides trusts a peer to provide a good \textit{service}. (It is not how much Slips trusts the data received from the peer, as this final trust by Slips may depend on data  that Slips has about the peer's IP address).

\item \textbf{Target}: An IoC of interest (e.g. an IP address or domain) that Slips has the capability to assign a score to.

\item \textbf{Remote Peer}. A peer that is on the Internet and it is connected to the global Slips P2P2 network.

\item \textbf{Local Peer}: The unique local instance of Slips that is connected to the global P2P network and runs Fides.
\end{itemize}
