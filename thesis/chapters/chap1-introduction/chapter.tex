\section{Problems we are solving}
\begin{enumerate}
\item How do we determine who and how much to trust in global peer-to-peer network, where peers can join and quickly leave and there is a possibility that all connected peers are adversarial.
\item Given that peers can join and leave any time, we will have problem with cold start. We need to come up with a way how can newcomers safely gain initial trust fast.
\item The main (but not only) purpose of the project is to be able to share threat intelligence over the network. How do we aggregate said threat intelligence into a single aggregated network opinion?
\item As a Slips administrator, I want to be able to share data only with (or trust incoming data only from) specific peers or specific organizations.
