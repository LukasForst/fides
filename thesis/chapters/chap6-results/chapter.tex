\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

In this chapter, we evaluate the results of the simulations that were designed in the previous chapter \ref{ch:experiments}.

There are too many different situations, to evaluate each setup completely.
For that reason, we focus mainly on evaluating Fides under specific conditions that verify its resilience in situations with many malicious peers.
After that, we focus on conditions where there are no malicious peers in the network and observe what behavior can we expect in such an environment.
In the last part of the evaluation, we will be looking at how a low percentage of malicious peers in the network influence the decisions made by Fides and how it affects the accuracy of the results.
