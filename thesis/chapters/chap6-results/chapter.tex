\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}
This chapter presents and evaluate the results of the simulations that were designed in the previous Chapter~\ref{ch:experiments}. Since there are too many different scenarios to evaluate each setup thoroughly, we mainly focus on evaluating Fides under specific conditions that verify its resilience. These conditions are the more important for the administrator, such as situations with many byzantine peers.

The evaluation focus on finding a scenario where there are as many adversarial peers as possible, and Fides is still able to guarantee that it can come up with the correct target score. This is worst case scenario that every trust model should be evaluated under, since there is no point in evaluating a situation only with good and trusted peers.

However, since the reader may be interested in trying different scenarios, we developed and published a simulation framework~\cite{fidesGithub} where anyone can verify and simulate any scenario they are interested in.

Note that all figures in this chapter can be replicated by re-running the simulation Python code in $simulations/cases/figures$~\cite{fidesGithub}.
The graphs may differ slightly because the threat intelligence and recommendations are sampled from a probability distribution as described in Section~\ref{sec:sampling-threat-intelligence}, but the overall results should be the same.
