\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

In this chapter, we evaluate the results of the simulations that were designed in the previous chapter \ref{ch:experiments}.

There are too many different situations, to evaluate each setup completely. Moreover, each situation can be modeled in the developed simulation framework that is part of the published source code~\cite{fidesGithub} and thus anybody can verify and simulate their own situation they are interested in.

For that reason, we focus mainly on evaluating Fides under specific conditions that verify its resilience in the situations with many byzantine peers.
We try to discover a situation where there are as much adversarial peers as possible and Fides is still able to guarantee that it is able to come up with correct target score.

Note, that all all figures in this chapter can be replicated by re-running the simulations that are stored in the package with the implementation $simulations/cases/figures$~\cite{fidesGithub}.
The graphs might be slightly different because the threat intelligence and recommendations are sampled as described in \ref{sec:sampling-threat-intelligence}, but the overall results should be the same.
