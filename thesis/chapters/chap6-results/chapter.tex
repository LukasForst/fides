\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

In this chapter, we evaluate the results of the simulations that were designed in the previous chapter~\ref{ch:experiments}.

There are too many different situations to evaluate each setup thoroughly. Moreover, one can model each case in the developed simulation framework that is part of the published source code~\cite{fidesGithub} and thus, anybody can verify and simulate the situation they are interested in.

For that reason, we focus mainly on evaluating Fides under specific conditions that verify its resilience in the situations with many byzantine peers.
We focus on finding a situation where there are as many adversarial peers as possible, and Fides is still able to guarantee that it can come up with the correct target score.

Note that all figures in this chapter can be replicated by re-running the simulations in $simulations/cases/figures$~\cite{fidesGithub} Python package in the implementation.
The graphs might differ slightly because the threat intelligence and recommendations are sampled as described in~\ref{sec:sampling-threat-intelligence}, but the overall results should be the same.
