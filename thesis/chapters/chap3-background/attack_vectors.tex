\section{Possible Attack Vectors}
\label{sec:attack-vectors}
As the trust model is computing how much to trust to which peer, it is an interesting endpoint for an attacker, which would like to manipulate the final decisions about targets being malicious or being.
Our trust model is exposed to several attack vectors that where the attacker can either manipulate with the \textit{service trust} or with the \textit{reputations} if the recommendation protocol is enabled. We classified the following attack vectors as relevant for our trust model.

\subsection{Influencing Service Trust}
\label{subsec:influencing-service-trust}
In this case, the aim of the attacker is to influence service trust of the local peer in itself. In other words, it is
