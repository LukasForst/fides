\chapter{Background}
\label{ch:background}
In this chapter, we will describe how we approached problems of trust in global peer-to-peer environment in section \ref{sec:computational-model},how can we evaluate single interaction between two peers in section \ref{sec:interaction-evaluation-strategies}, how we mitigate cold start problem \ref{sec:cold-start-problem} and finally, how do we aggregate network threat intelligence into a single network opinion in section \ref{sec:network-intelligence-aggregation}.

Our trust model, Fides, operates in four phases, first it receives data, then it aggregates the data, evaluates the interactions with each peer and as a last step it updates the service trust for the next interaction.
See figure \ref{fig:trust-model-life-cycle}, where is this process visualized.

In the following sections we will be using following terminology and words when talking about the trust model.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fides} - name of the trust model, performs all trust related computations
\item \textbf{service trust} - how much a trust model trust a peer to provide us a good service - it is not necessarily how much we trust the data we received from the peer as to the final computation we may include the information about peer's IP address from the Slips (what does Slips think about the IP address)
\item \textbf{target} - an IP address or domain - point of interest that can be source of network traffic and Slips has a capability to assign threat intelligence data to this object
\item \textbf{remote peer} - peer that is running somewhere on the internet and it is connected to the global peer-to-peer network
\item \textbf{local peer} - local instance of Slips that is connected to the global peer-to-peer network and runs instance of Fides
