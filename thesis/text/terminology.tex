\subsection{Terminology}
\textbf{The problem:} here I want to describe what terminology I'm using

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Fides} - name of the trust model, performs all trust related computations
\item \textbf{service trust} - how much a trust model trust a peer to provide us a good service - it is not necessarily how much we trust the data we received from the peer as to the final computation we may include the information about peer's IP address from the Slips (what does Slips think about the IP address)
\item \textbf{target} - an IP address or domain - point of interest that can be source of network traffic and Slips has a capability to assign threat intelligence data to this object
\item \textbf{remote peer} - peer that is running somewhere on the internet and it is connected to the global peer-to-peer network
\item \textbf{local peer} - local instance of Slips that is connected to the global peer-to-peer network and runs instance of Fides
\end{itemize}
