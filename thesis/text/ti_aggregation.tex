\subsection{Network Intelligence Aggregation}
Fides is a trust model designed for global peer-to-peer network that is created by instances of Slips.
It is designed to support Slips in detecting malicious actors on the network and enables threat intelligence sharing between peers of Slips instances.
Because Slips was designed to be as modular as possible, Fides is effectively running as a module which provides aggregated threat intelligence to Slips. 
In other words, Fides provides a view on what does the network think about some threat intelligence target.

This means that Fides needs to be able to aggregate elements of threat intelligence from remote peers ($S^{k}_{j, T}$, $C^{k}_{j, T}$) into a single value that is then presented to Slips - ($S^{k}_{T}$, $C^{k}_{T}$) - a network opinion on given target $T$ in window $k$.

The inputs for the network intelligence aggregation algorithm is collection of threat intelligence reports from the remote peers where each record contains following information:
\begin{enumerate}
\item service trust - $st_{i, j}$ - trust in remote peer $j$ that it provides expected service, in other words, how much does local peer $i$ trust the data it receives from remote peer $j$
\item threat intelligence about target $T$ provided by remote peer $j$ - ($S^{k}_{j, T}$, $C^{k}_{j, T}$)
\end{enumerate}
