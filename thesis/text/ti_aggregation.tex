\subsection{Network Intelligence Aggregation}
Fides is a trust model designed for global peer-to-peer network that is created by instances of Slips.
It is designed to support Slips in detecting malicious actors on the network and enables threat intelligence sharing between peers of Slips instances.
Because Slips was designed to be as modular as possible, Fides is effectively running as a module which provides aggregated threat intelligence to Slips. 
In other words, Fides provides a view on what does the network think about some threat intelligence target.

This means that Fides needs to be able to aggregate elements of threat intelligence from remote peers ($S^{k}_{j, T}$, $C^{k}_{j, T}$) into a single value that is then presented to Slips - ($S^{k}_{T}$, $C^{k}_{T}$).
